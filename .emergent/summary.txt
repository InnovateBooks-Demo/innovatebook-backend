<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial goal was to build a Super Admin portal and an Intelligence module. This has since evolved into a comprehensive overhaul of the public-facing website to be highly interactive and visually consistent, taking inspiration from the ClearTax website.

The user's most recent and explicit requests were:
1.  **Complete Interactive Overhaul:** Make *all* public-facing pages interactive, dynamic, and visually engaging, adhering to the ClearTax design philosophy.
2.  **Brand Color Consistency:** Strictly use the brand color  across all marketing pages, removing semantic colors like green and purple unless they convey specific status (e.g., success/error in the app).
3.  **Functional Interactive Demos:** Add interactive product demos to the homepage, all solution overview pages, and the authenticated Workspace and Intelligence dashboards. The solution tabs on the homepage must trigger a live, working demo for the selected solution.
4.  **Homepage Content & Design:**
    *   Set the main heading to Financial Intelligence That Works for You.
    *   Replace the static Intelligence Layer image with a live, interactive mini-dashboard.
    *   Use random, non-reputed company names in the trusted by marquee.
5.  **Login/Signup Redesign:** Overhaul the login and signup pages with new content and a modern design that fits on a single, non-scrollable screen.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application is a full-stack SaaS platform. The public-facing website has undergone a massive transformation into a highly interactive experience. A new library of over 17 reusable interactive components has been created under  to standardize the new design.

Key achievements include:
-   **Complete Page Rewrites:** , , and  have been rewritten from scratch to be highly interactive.
-   **Login/Signup Overhaul:**  and  have been redesigned into modern, single-screen, non-scrollable pages.
-   **Interactive Demo Integration:** A reusable  component has been created and successfully integrated into the homepage, all five solution overview pages, the Workspace dashboard, the Intelligence dashboard, and the Intelligence overview page.
-   **Homepage Functionality:** The homepage now features a dynamic solutions section where clicking a solution tab (e.g., Commerce) displays a functional, interactive mini-dashboard for that specific solution. The hero text, trust marquee, and intelligence section have all been updated as per user requirements.
-   **Brand Consistency:** All public-facing marketing pages have been updated to use the primary brand color (), fixing previous inconsistencies.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was implementing the final set of user requests to complete the website's interactive overhaul. This involved making the homepage solution tabs trigger a real demo, adding demos to the Workspace/Intelligence pages, and fixing all remaining color inconsistencies.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent. The scope of changes is massive, touching nearly every public-facing page. A full regression test is required to ensure all new interactive elements are functional and no existing features have broken.
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: Comprehensive Verification of Interactive Overhaul (P0 - HIGHEST PRIORITY)**
    -   **Description:** The agent implemented a large-scale redesign across the entire public website. While individual changes were spot-checked with screenshots, a full, end-to-end test has not been performed to confirm stability and functionality.
    -   **Attempted fixes:** N/A
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        -   Execute the  to perform a full regression test on the frontend.
        -   Focus the test on all rewritten pages (, , ), redesigned pages (, ), and pages with new demos (solution overviews, , ).
        -   Manually verify that clicking each solution tab on the homepage loads the correct and functional interactive demo.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To validate that the user's extensive requirements for the interactive overhaul have been met successfully without introducing new bugs.
    -   **Status:** TESTING PENDING
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Complete and Verify Interactive Website Overhaul (P0 - HIGHEST PRIORITY)**
    -   **Where to resume:** The implementation of all user requests is complete. The next critical step is to run a comprehensive test using the frontend testing agent.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** The entire public website will be validated as fully interactive, visually consistent, and aligned with the user's ClearTax-inspired vision.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    -   **Blocked on something:** No

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**

**Upcoming Tasks:**
-   **Task 1: Integrate 'Try Before Clone' Modal (P0)**
    -   The  component has been created. The next step is to connect it to the clone or activate buttons within the authenticated sections to trigger the demo before a user commits to an action.

**Future Tasks:**
-   **Task 2: Add Analytics (P2)**
    -   Implement analytics tracking for key user interactions, such as product tour completion, demo engagement, and pricing plan interactions.
-   **Task 3: A/B Testing (P2)**
    -   Plan and implement A/B tests on CTA placements and other interactive elements to optimize conversion.

-   After verifying the current work, the next task from the backlog is to connect the  to the clone/activate buttons in the authenticated part of the app. You should propose this as the next step.
-   The user frequently approves large batches of work with complete everything, so be prepared to plan and execute multiple related tasks at once.
